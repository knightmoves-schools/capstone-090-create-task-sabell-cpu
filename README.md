Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Develop programs for multiple computing platforms. (3B-AP-19) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Construct solutions to problems using student-created components, such as procedures, modules and/or objects. (3B-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Use lists to simplify solutions, generalizing computational problems instead of repeatedly using simple variables. (3A-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
